# Ripple Avatar Creator — Project Brief

The north star for this project. Per-feature detail lives in `features/<slug>/SPEC.md`
(produced by `/create-spec`) and `features/<slug>/PLAN.md` (produced by `/create-plan`).
Keep this doc short and update it when the vision shifts.

## What we're making

Our take on Roblox's [Catalog Avatar Creator](https://www.roblox.com/games/7041939546/Catalog-Avatar-Creator)
(CAC, by @Muneeb): an experience where players try on catalog items for free, build
and save outfits, and buy what they like — with purchases landing in their real Roblox
inventory.

We differentiate on three fronts:

1. **Our own design and a tidier HUD.** CAC is HUD-heavy with almost nothing in the
   world. We use the world: a series of **interactable monoliths** that host
   secondary functionality diegetically, keeping the HUD focused on core
   try-on/browse/buy.
2. **A points economy with UGC auctions** (retention).
3. **Item-to-item recommendations** powered by our own external services.

## Workstreams

### 1. CAC adaptation pass

Take the features we like from CAC, change what we don't, and apply our own design —
all within the template's MVC architecture and react-luau UI system (`views/components`,
`views/hooks`, `HudApp`).

CAC's public feature set, as a starting checklist to keep / change / cut:

- Free try-on of catalog items: accessories, hats, limiteds, hair combos, bundles,
  animation packs, clothing
- Catalog browsing, search and filtering
- Body customisation: body type, scaling (height, width, head, proportions), colours
- Save avatars created in-experience; load another user's outfit
- Outfit share codes
- A large library of community-created outfits to browse (CAC claims 50M+)
- Purchasing items in-experience (they go to the player's Roblox inventory)
- Group join call-to-action

### 2. Points & UGC auctions

- Players **earn points** for spending Robux in-experience and for a handful of other
  tasks (e.g. joining the group, inviting friends).
- **Every point gained and spent is logged per user** (an auditable ledger, not just a
  balance).
- Points are spent on **minted UGC** via an in-game, eBay-style **auction system**.
- Why: better value than the marketplace for the player's spend; an active auction
  gives us a legitimate reason to re-engage players (notifications); and minting UGC
  associated with the experience helps discovery.

### 3. Recommendation engine

- Recommend items based on an item a user has clicked, liked, worn, etc.
- The **UGC-to-UGC connection services live outside this repo.** This repo is the
  client of those services: it emits the signals they need (views, try-ons, likes,
  wears, purchases) and renders the recommendations they return.

## Design principles

- **Diegetic first.** If a feature isn't core to the try-on/buy loop, give it a
  monolith in the world before giving it HUD space.
- **Template architecture, not around it.** New features are new Models / Controllers /
  Views / Services / Configs, following `docs/*_GUIDE.md`.
- **Server-authoritative economy.** Points, auctions and the ledger are server state;
  clients only express intent.

## Decisions

- **Template example features** (Candles, Shrine, Cash Machine, Bazaar, Favours,
  gold/treasure Inventory) stay for now and are replaced as our own features land.
  They're the worked examples in `docs/` and `.claude/commands/`, so when one is
  removed, update those references in the same change.
- **Workstream 1 kicks off from a design** made in Claude Design, which seeds the
  `/create-spec` discussion.

## Open questions

- Points earn rates, auction mechanics (duration, bid increments, snipe protection),
  UGC minting pipeline and supply.
- Contract with the external recommendation service (transport, auth, payloads).
- Monolith roster: which features get one, and how they're placed.
